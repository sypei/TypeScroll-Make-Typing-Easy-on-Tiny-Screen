# TypeScroll-Make-Typing-Easy-on-Tiny-Screen

A new typing entry method for small input area, inspired by "scrolls".

Samll input area (small screens) are common for smartwatches, smart fridge panels, and other IoT devices user interfaces.

TypeScroll makes typing easy on these tiny screens. It is developed with html and javascript. 

You can try it by downloading the .html files, opening them on your phone in a browser (of course phone has a large screen compared with our target tiny screen, but you can imagine only the central area of phone is activated and experience our product).
The concept is proved with the webpage. It can be deployed to tiny screens if you like.

Thanks!
